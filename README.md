# Monte Carlo Pricing Methods and Simulations

At the expiry date t = T the option price is known as a function of the current stock and the strike price. 

The essence of the Monte Carlo method is to carry out a simulation experiment
by finding the solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) from time t = 0 to time t = T.

This process allows us to compute the stock price t = T and then the option price using the payoff function.

We carry out M simulations or draws by finding the solution of the SDE and we calculate price at t = T.

Finally, we calculate the discounted average of the simulated payoff.

Summerize, the process is:

1. Construct a simulation path of the underlying stock

2. Calculate the stock price at t = T

3. Calculate the call price at t = T (use the payoff function)

Execute steps 1-3 M times

4. Calculate the averaged call price t = T

5. Discount the price found in step 4 to t = 0

* **Mathematical background**

Replace continuous time by discrete time, by divide the interval [0,T] where T is expiry date into a number of subintervals

In this case, a set of intervals:

Therefore, this can be examined the SDE with constant coefficients:

This can be written as a stochastic integral equation between times s and t as follows:

Evaluate at two consecutive mesh points and using the fact that a and b are constant

Replace the solution X of equation by a new discrete function Y

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/SaraPeyko/MonteCarloMethodsSimulations/blob/master/Captures/Capture7.JPG"></p>

This is called Euler method when approximating the solution of SDEs which cen write the discrete equation above in the equivalent form

The mesh size is constant and the Wiener increments are computable quantities:

The increments of the Wiener process can be generated by a random number generator for independent Gaussian pseudo-random numbers, this program focused on the generators in Boost Random.

* **Advanced Monte Carlo**

Add functionalities to the Monte Carlo pricer by providing estimates for standard deviation (SD) and standard error (SE), defined by:
